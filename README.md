# Phonetic Password "Translator"

This program is designed to translate a given password of upper-case and lower-case letters, numbers, and US-keyboard symbols into a readable, pronounceable, and phonetically shareable string.  

## Getting Started

This program is written in Python 3, but could easily be adapted to Python 2 if necessary.  It is entirely command-line, and no other modules are used.

### Prerequisites

Python 3 installed.

### Installing

Merely download the Python file, and run it.

### Running the program

After running the program, you will be prompted for a password.  This is in plain-text, because the whole point of this is to improve a passwords readability.  Upon entering the password, you will be presented with the password you just entered, for clarity, as well as its length.

After that, you will see the Phonetic Output of the password:
* Words in ALL UPPER CASE represent a capital letter in the password
* Words in all lower case represent a lower-case letter in the password
* All numbers are spelled out
* All symbols are spelled out, according to their ASCII names
* Unrecognized characters (like those not on a standard US keyboard), will be labeled such, and there will be a sentance below calling that out.
